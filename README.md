Project 1 of The Odin Project foundations course
- Build out a recipe webpage that consists of a few different recipes linked with anchor tags from the homepage
- Include use of header tags, an image, and an unordered list, and ordered list

I only did one recipe here, as this part of the course is refresher for me and I feel comfortable still with HTML.
